# Speech Recognition Project
This project is a simple Python program that performs speech recognition using Google's speech recognition API and the SpeechRecognition library. The program listens to audio input from the computer's microphone, transcribes it to text, and prints the results to the console.

# The requirements for the program are the following: :

1. Python: You will need to have Python installed on your computer to run the program. 

You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. SpeechRecognition library: The program uses the SpeechRecognition library to perform speech recognition. You can install it using pip, the Python package manager, by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

                    pip install SpeechRecognition
                    
3. Microphone: The program uses the computer's microphone as the audio source for speech recognition. Make sure that your computer has a functioning microphone that is properly connected.

4. Internet connection: The program uses Google's speech recognition API to transcribe the speech to text. You will need an internet connection to use this API.

# how to use
To use the program, run the main.py file using Python. Make sure that your computer's microphone is properly connected and functioning before running the program.

The program will prompt you to speak into the microphone by displaying the message "Speak Anything : " on the console. You can speak any words or phrases that you want, and the program will attempt to transcribe them to text using Google's speech recognition API.

Once you have finished speaking, the program will attempt to transcribe the audio to text and display the results on the console. If the program is able to recognize the speech, it will display the message "You said : [transcribed text]". If the program is unable to recognize the speech, it will display the message "Sorry, could not recognize your voice".

Note ::
The speech recognition functionality was implemented using the SpeechRecognition library and Google's speech recognition API.
